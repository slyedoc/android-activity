[patch.crates-io]
# Note:
# Since android-activity is responsible for invoking the `android_main`
# entrypoint for a native Rust application there can only be a single
# implementation of the crate linked with the application.
#
# To avoid conflicts it's generally recommend to rely on Winit to pull
# in a compatible version of android-activity but if you'd like to build
# this example against the local checkout of android-activity you should
# specify a patch here to make sure you also affect the version that Winit
# uses.
#
# Note: also check that the local android-activity/Cargo.toml version matches
# the version of android-activity that Winit depends on (in case you need to check
# out a release branch locally to be compatible)
